**The first AI-powered, voice-guided remote viewing trainer based on declassified CIA protocols.**

Train your consciousness using the same techniques explored in the CIA's Gateway Process and Stargate Project. Features real-time binaural beat generation and an AI guide that speaks to you through your session—just like the human monitors did at Fort Meade.

## What is Gateway Trainer?

Gateway Trainer combines two declassified CIA research programs into one training application:

**The Gateway Process (1983)**  
Binaural beat technology investigated by Army Intelligence for inducing altered states of consciousness. The famous "Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process" document explored how specific audio frequencies could synchronize brain hemispheres and potentially enable expanded awareness.

**The Stargate Project (1972-1995)**  
A $20M+ program that trained remote viewers to perceive distant targets using only their minds. Viewers were given coordinates or sealed envelopes and asked to describe what they "saw." The program employed 22+ active viewers and ran for over two decades.

**The Connection**  
CIA sent Stargate remote viewers to the Monroe Institute for Gateway training. Gateway was the *method* to achieve the right brain state. Stargate was the *application* of that state.

Gateway Trainer recreates this pipeline—binaural beats to shift your consciousness, then AI-guided remote viewing exercises to train your perception.

## Features

- **Real-Time Binaural Beat Generation** — Pure tones generated in your browser using Web Audio API. No audio files, no downloads.

- **Four Focus Levels** — Progress from Focus 10 (Mind Awake, Body Asleep) through Focus 21 (The Bridge), following Monroe Institute terminology.

- **AI Voice Guide** — An AI monitor speaks to you throughout your session, guiding you through the remote viewing process with a calm, meditative voice.

- **Two-Way Voice Conversation** — Speak your impressions naturally. The AI listens, responds, and guides you deeper—completely hands-free.

- **15 Target Categories** — Train with geographic locations, structures, objects, and nature scenes based on actual Stargate target categories.

- **Intelligent Scoring** — AI analyzes your impressions against target attributes and provides nuanced feedback, not just "right" or "wrong."

- **Session Tracking** — Track your accuracy over time, maintain streaks, and watch your perception improve.

- **Declassified Aesthetic** — UI designed to look like aged CIA documents, complete with classification stamps and manila folder textures.

## How It Works

### Training Mode

1. Put on headphones (required for binaural beats)
2. Select your session length and number of targets
3. Binaural beats begin at Focus 10 (10 Hz)
4. AI guide speaks: *"Take a deep breath. Let your body relax into the sound..."*
5. A sealed "classified envelope" appears on screen
6. Describe your impressions by speaking naturally
7. AI asks follow-up questions about colors, shapes, textures, scale
8. Reveal the target and receive detailed feedback
9. Continue through remaining targets
10. Review session summary and share your results

### Exploration Mode

Pure consciousness exploration without targets. Select a Focus level, set your duration, and let the binaural beats guide you into expanded states. Optional journaling after each session.

### Quick Session

Minimal interface for experienced users. Just tones and a timer.

## The Science

### Binaural Beats

When two slightly different frequencies are played separately to each ear, the brain perceives a phantom "beat" at the difference frequency. A 200 Hz tone in one ear and 210 Hz in the other creates a perceived 10 Hz beat.

This phenomenon, called the Frequency Following Response, can shift brainwave activity toward target states:

| State | Frequency | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Delta | 0.5-4 Hz | Deep sleep, cellular repair |
| Theta | 4-8 Hz | REM sleep, deep meditation |
| Alpha | 8-12 Hz | Relaxed awareness |
| Beta | 12-30 Hz | Active thinking |
| Gamma | 30-100 Hz | Peak perception |

### Focus Levels

Gateway Trainer uses the Monroe Institute's Focus level system:

| Level | Beat Frequency | State |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Focus 10 | 10 Hz | Mind Awake, Body Asleep |
| Focus 12 | 7 Hz | Expanded Awareness |
| Focus 15 | 5 Hz | No Time |
| Focus 21 | 4 Hz | The Bridge |

## Historical Context

### The Missing Page 25

The Gateway Process document was declassified in 2003, but Page 25 was missing. The CIA claimed for 18 years it "never existed." In 2021, journalist Thobey Campion discovered the Monroe Institute had the complete document—they simply emailed it to him.

Page 25 discussed consciousness and "the Absolute," describing how self-awareness serves as "the model around which the evolution of time-space revolves."

### Global Programs

The US wasn't alone:

- **Soviet Union** — Spent an estimated $500M-$1B on psychotronics research
- **China** — The 507 Research Institute studied "Human Science" until 1999
- **UK** — Ministry of Defence conducted remote viewing tests in 2002
- **Israel** — Uri Geller was tested at Stanford Research Institute in 1973

The US program was largely initiated due to fear of a "psychic gap" with the Soviets.

### Program Termination

Stargate was shut down in 1995. The official review concluded results were "too vague and inconsistent for actionable intelligence." However, statistician Jessica Utts found subjects scored 5-15% above chance—statistically significant, if not operationally useful.

## Disclaimer

Gateway Trainer is for entertainment and educational purposes only. This application is not a medical device and makes no therapeutic claims.

Based on declassified CIA documents that explored consciousness research from 1972-1995. The scientific status of remote viewing remains disputed. The CIA's Stargate program was shut down in 1995 after reviews concluded results were "too vague and inconsistent for actionable intelligence."

Binaural beats may cause relaxation. Do not use while driving or operating machinery. Consult a physician if you have a history of seizures.

**We cannot guarantee which dimension you'll visit, only that you'll probably visit one of them. Results may vary. The CIA couldn't figure it out either.**

Built for explorers. Use responsibly.
